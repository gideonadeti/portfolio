Over the past few days, Iâ€™ve been working on updating my portfolio.  
I added more depth to the **About**, expanded my **Experience** and **Education**, refined my **Skills**, and showcased my **Projects** in a clearer way.

It feels good to finally bring everything up to date. With this fresh portfolio, I feel readier and more confident to start applying to jobs and taking the next step in my career. ðŸš€
