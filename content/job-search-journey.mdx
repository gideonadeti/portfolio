I've tried this several times before...starting a job search, getting organized, putting myself out there. Each time, I wasn't successful. But here I am again, and this time feels different.

I'm following the structured getting hired course (for the severalth time...lol), and I'm approaching it with renewed determination. I know the process, I know what needs to be done, and I'm ready to commit fully to making this work.

To kick things off, I've updated all my profiles: LinkedIn, GitHub, Resume, and this portfolio website.

I know I might need to reupdate these in the near future as I learn more about what works and what doesn't, but that's all part of the process.

It's going to be tough...there's no sugarcoating that. The job market is competitive, rejections are inevitable, and the journey can be mentally draining. But I'm reminding myself that it's going to be worth it. Every application, every interview, every piece of feedback is a step forward.

Soon, hopefully, I'll land a job that meets my preferences...one where I can grow, contribute meaningfully, and be part of something great. Until then, I'll keep pushing forward, learning, and improving.

Here's to making it happen this time. 🚀
