I'm excited to share that I've completed the preparation stage of my job search journey! It's been a busy period of updates, improvements, and getting everything in order.

## What I've Accomplished

**Project Documentation**: I revamped 5 out of 6 of my pinned GitHub projects with well-documented READMEs. This was crucial—I wanted to make sure anyone viewing my projects could quickly understand what each one does, how to set it up, and what technologies were used. Good documentation shows attention to detail and makes a strong impression.

**Profile Updates**: I've updated my resume, LinkedIn profile, and GitHub profile to reflect my current skills, experience, and projects. Everything is now aligned and tells a cohesive story about who I am as an engineer.

**Clarity on Goals**: I've taken time to really think through what I'm looking for in my next role. Having that clarity upfront will help me target the right opportunities and ask the right questions during interviews.

## What's Next

There's still one more thing I need to set up: a system to track my applications. I'm planning to either create a Google Sheet or explore platforms designed for job application tracking. Staying organized throughout this process is going to be key to managing the volume of applications and following up appropriately.

Now that the preparation is done, it's time to start applying. I'm ready to put myself out there, learn from each experience, and hopefully land a role where I can continue to grow and contribute meaningfully.

All the best to me! 🚀
